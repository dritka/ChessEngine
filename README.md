# ChessEngine
At the time when I started this project,
I got interested in Data Structures &
Algorithms. Pretty recently I had watched
a video on youtube about a simple AI algorithm
called the mini-max algorithm by Sebastian Lague 
, for whom I am very thankful for providing a detailed
and easy to follow explanation,(the link of the video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI). At first, 
I implemented the algorithm in a console style tic-tac-toe game.
Then I thought of combining my love of chess with programming, so
I got the idea to make a chess engine that implemented this exact
algorithm. At the time that I'm writing this, approximately 3 years
have passed since I started the project, and it's still in the making.
The reason for this is that I got lazy, I got kind of bored with the
project, but I also had other responsibilities and personal issues. But
now I'm going to finish once and for all. You can find the features
that I still have to implement in the TO_DO.txt file, which also includes
other remarks.
