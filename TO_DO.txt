Features to be implemented

--> Aesthetics
- Add more piece themes
- Give the user the options to choose the pieces they want to play (white or black)

--> Functionality
- Implement the minimax algorithm
- Optimize minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- Optimize the move calculation function
- Debug and resolve en passant issue [Done]
- Test and make sure en passant works correctly [Done]
- In the case when a check is given, stop the user from making a move
that leaves the king vulnerable to attack again

--> Remarks
Currently the way the app is structured seems a bit messy and not very easily modifiable.
It should be refactored in a way such that it is easier to integrate new feature into the
application, such as new game modes, new moves and so on.
