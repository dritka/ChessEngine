Functionalities that need to be implemented
- In the case when a check is given, stop the user from making a move
that leaves the king vulnerable to attack again
- Test the application by playing some games
- Review the code and make final adjustments
- Implement the minimax algorithm
- Optimize minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- Add more piece themes
